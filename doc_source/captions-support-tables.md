# Captions supported by AWS Elemental MediaConvert<a name="captions-support-tables"></a>

MediaConvert supports a wide range of captions conversion workflows\. But you can't convert every supported input captions format to every supported output captions format\. Each video container supports a subset of all possible captions types\. Furthermore, MediaConvert supports a subset of all transformations theoretically allowed within the input and output video container type\.

To look up whether MediaConvert supports your captions workflow, choose the topic from the following list that corresponds to your input captions\. Find the table that corresponds to your video output container\. Then find the row for your input captions\. Check the supported output captions format column to see the available output captions formats\.
+ If your primary MediaConvert input contains your captions, see [Supported captions workflows, input captions in the same file as video](captions-support-tables-by-container-type.md)\.
+ If your captions are in a separate file, which you specify in your input captions selector, see [Supported captions workflows, sidecar input captions](sidecar-captions-support-tables-by-container-type.md)\.
